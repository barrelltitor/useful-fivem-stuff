# State Bag Rate Limiter Configuration
#
# These settings prevent abuse of state bag updates from clients.
# They are meant to safeguard server stability and memory usage, however they can cause reliable event overflow errors.
#
# WARNING: These values are already very high, if you have issues you should check your resources as something is likely not right with them.

# --- Regular State Bag Limiter ---

# The maximum number of state bag change packets a client can send per second.
# This prevents spammy or excessive updates.
set rateLimiter_stateBag_rate 75

# The "burst" limit â€” how many packets can be sent in a short time before the limiter kicks in.
# If a client exceeds this, they'll be blocked from sending more state bags for 1 second.
set rateLimiter_stateBag_burst 125

# --- Flood Protection Limiter ---

# This is a secondary limiter that detects flood-like behavior.
# If a client exceeds this number of state bag updates per second, it's treated as a flood attempt.
# Clients flooding will be dropped to avoid server issues.
set rateLimiter_stateBagFlood_rate 150

# The burst limit for the flood detection. If exceeded, the client is kicked from the server.
set rateLimiter_stateBagFlood_burst 175

# --- State Bag Size Limiter ---

# The total size (in bytes) of state bag data a client can send per second.
# Helps prevent memory exhaustion and overloading the network thread.
set rateLimiter_stateBagSize_rate 131072  # 128 KB/sec

# The burst size limit (in bytes). If a client sends too much data too quickly, they'll be dropped.
set rateLimiter_stateBagSize_burst 262144  # 256 KB/sec
